# Sensor Variable Font Workshop - Processing Community Day 2021 Porto
A one-day beginner-level workshop on interactive typography in semantic interfaces controlled by physical computing.

About this Event

Cities are rapidly evolving towards the so-called Smart cities, where the Internet of Things (IoT) and the hyperconnectivity of citizens are creating new coexistence and interaction paradigms. The experiences with the interfaces can become much more meaningful due to the use of variable fonts, whose potential lies in turning typography into something alive, capable of adapting to the environment around it.

The goal of this workshop is to introduce participants to improve the user experience of graphical interfaces by creating a semantic relationship between typography and data collected by sensors.

This is a one-day beginner-level workshop. Participants will be introduced to the new font technology variable fonts, to connect sensors to the open-source board Arduino and learn the tools to synchronize the data and the typeface through HTML, CSS, and Javascript (JS).

Requirements

Participants must have access to a personal computer with a modern browser (e.g. Chrome), a stable Internet connection to participate in the workshop via Zoom. Plus, the following Arduino components*:

- Arduino Uno or higher with a USB wire.
- Protoboard, wires, and some resistors.
- At least one of these sensors: ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04, light Dependent PhotoResistor (LDR), or a water level sensor. You can also try with other sensors later.

*There are basic Arduino kits that have the components specified above.

We recommend that you already have the following software installed:

- Visual Studio Code
- Arduino IDE
- Node Js
- Git
- Yarn 

A short tutorial on how to install the software mentioned above is available at the following link: https://sensorvariablefont.com/variable-font/installation-tutorial/


Instructors

Iván Huelves develops his professional career as an accredited teacher, by the Master's Degree in Teacher Training, in the field of graphic design, interactivity, and new technologies at the Escuela Superior de Diseño de Madrid. He combines his lectures with a line of research into interactive typography under a Ph.D. program in Design at Universidad Complutense de Madrid and his professional activity as a freelance graphic designer. He has published research papers in several international conferences and journals. Additional info and links: https://ivanhuelves.com/
